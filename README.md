# 📺 SeriesLens
🔍 AI-Enhanced TV Series Analysis & Character Interaction

SeriesLens is an AI-powered framework designed to analyze TV series using NLP, LLMs, and character interactions. It enables users to chat with their favorite TV series characters, classify themes, extract character networks, and analyze series transcripts.

## 🚀 Features
- 🗣️ Character Chatbot – Chat with TV series characters using LLM-powered conversational AI.

- 📊 Theme Classification – Identify and categorize themes in series scripts using zero-shot classifiers.

- 🕵️ Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Extract character names and interactions to build a character network.

- 🤖 Custom LLM Text Classifier – Train a personalized text classification model for deeper series analysis.

- 📡 Data Scraping – Collect and process custom dataset for improved model training.

cd SeriesLens
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting point :
The scope of this project is to built a character Chatbot to chat with your favorite TV series characters, analyze a series with NLP and LLMs, scrape our own dataset, use zero shot classifiers, build our own LLM text classifier, use NER to build a character network and build a character chatbot to chat..
